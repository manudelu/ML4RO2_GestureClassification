Machine Learning for Robotics II
===================================================
Gesture Classification using Support Vector Classifier and Random Forest
---------------------------------------------------
This project revolves around classifying hand gestures based on muscle activity recordings using machine learning models, primarily Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Random Forest (RF). The data is collected from sensors placed on the hand during gesture execution, processed, and fed into these models for classification.
